After a few years working in production he founded internationally represented motion studio Upper First. In 2016 he took the helm of an agency film department before getting back to his roots with Dunderville. Most important to Erik? Be nice, work hard, do good."

After learning the ropes of animation at Hyper Island, he honed his skills at Upper First. Since 2010 he has been working with composition, production management of external freelancers and most recently, producing  and directing 2D and 3D-animation projects. Jonas is always ready to go that extra klick for a well executed production. Hooah!"
